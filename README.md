# Gnome Space Program

Some things to note:
A couple textures in the game are from freepbr.com and don't allow commercial use. ``Look at Gnome-Space-Program/Assets/Textures/000_TEXTURE_CREDIT.txt``
I intend to remove these textures and replace them with my own before releasing this game commercially
